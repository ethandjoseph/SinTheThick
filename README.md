# Sinthethicc
 Simple flute-like synth with unique thicc'ning algo.

 The thicc'ning algo is inspired by a discussion that I had with Mr. Krishna Chetan of Pitch Innovations wherein he briefly spoke about the idea of using parallel reverbs to "thicken a sound".
 I decided to give this a shot but by refining it using my [overtonePass filter](https://github.com/ethandjoseph/Overtone-Pass-Filter).

Future goals:
1. Make polyphonic
2. Convert into audio effect with polyphonic pitch tracking
