# SinThiccizer
 Simple flute-like synth with unique thicc'ning algo.

 The thicc'ning algo is inspired by a discussion that I had with [Mr. Krishna Chetan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishna-chetan-t-r-8b0a2a66/) of [Pitch Innovations](https://www.pitchinnovations.com/) wherein he briefly spoke about the idea of using parallel reverbs to "thicken a sound".
 I decided to give this a shot, but by refining it using my [overtonePass filter](https://github.com/ethandjoseph/Overtone-Pass-Filter).

### Future goals:
1. Make polyphonic
2. Convert into audio effect with polyphonic pitch tracking
